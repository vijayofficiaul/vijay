        <h1>Project Two</h1>

        <p>A Robust Marriage Events Management System Integrating
            Intelligent Scheduling, and Tailored Recommendations</p>

        <h2>Key Points:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Centralized Event Planning:

                Centralized event planning refers to the process of managing and organizing all aspects of an event from a single, unified platform or system.
                This system enables event planners to streamline their workflow by consolidating tasks such as venue booking, scheduling, attendee registration, and communication into one centralized location.</li>
            <li>Cost Optimization Features:

                Cost optimization features are functionalities incorporated into event planning systems to help organizers maximize their budget efficiency and minimize unnecessary expenses.
                These features may include budget tracking tools, expense management modules, and cost analysis capabilities to monitor spending throughout the event planning lifecycle.</li>
            <li>Vendor Management:

                Vendor management involves the process of sourcing, selecting, contracting, and managing external suppliers or vendors involved in providing goods or services for an event.
                Event planning systems may include features specifically designed for vendor management, such as vendor directories, request for proposal (RFP) management, and contract management tools.</li>
            <li>Decision Support System:

                A decision support system (DSS) provides event planners with data-driven insights and analysis to facilitate informed decision-making throughout the event planning process.
                </li>
            <li>Security and Privacy Measures:

                Security and privacy measures are critical aspects of event planning systems to safeguard sensitive information, ensure compliance with regulations, and mitigate the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.
                These measures encompass various security protocols, encryption techniques, access controls, and compliance frameworks implemented to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</li>
        </ul>
